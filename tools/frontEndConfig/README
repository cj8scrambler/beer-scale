Command line utility to configure the configuration database which the
frontend web app uses.

Be sure to update these 2 variables in the config.py script before running:
  STORAGE_ACCT_NAME
  STORAGE_ACCT_KEY

To run in a virutal env:
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python ./config.py

Note: A scale must report some data in order to create an entry in the
configuration database.  So the arduino based hardware setup, or the
emulator script needs to be used to populate the configuration database
before this script is run to edit the details.
